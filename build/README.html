    <h1>How to use</h1>
    <p>First, extract the distro zip file, then double-click <code>index.html</code>, or click <a
            href="./index.html">this link</a> to go there.</p>
    <p>Next, create a key pair. Select "I want to: Generate a public-private key pair". Then, press "Generate
        Public-Private Key Pair". Two buttons named "Download public key" and "Download private key" should show up
        under "Output". Download both of them, and keep them.</p>
    <p>If you want somebody to send you a message, send them the public key. Don't worry, as messages encrypted with the
        public key can only be decrypted by the private key, which means that <b>you must keep the private key
            safe.</b><br><br> Remember, <b>Share the PUBLIC key</b>, <b>Keep SECRET the PRIVATE key</b>.</p>
    <p>To encrypt a message, select "I want to: Encrypt an outbound message". Then, click "Choose File" under "public
        key of the reciever", then press "Load Public Key". It's successful when the filename shows up in green text.</p>
